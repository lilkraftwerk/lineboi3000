# Getting Started

I haven't set up Electron app packaging yet, so you can run locally via `npm` or `yarn`.

## Quick Start

### Install

`yarn` or `npm i` to install all dependencies

### Run The App

`yarn dev` or `npm dev` to run the dev server (devtools open, and Webpack rebuilds on changes to files)

`yarn start` or `npm start` to run the dev server

## Useful Yarn/NPM Commands

In a terminal window, navigate to the main folder and enter `yarn [command]` or `npm [command]`
